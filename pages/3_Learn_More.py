The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all. 
Explore [UN SDG Resources](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) for more information.

This tool provides insights into how individual decisions can influence these goals. 
Check the "Explore Data" section to view trends and "Simulation" to experiment with potential impacts.

# ### What are the SDGs?
# The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the United Nations in 2015, are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals
# designed to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. Each goal is associated with specific indicators and targets.
#
# ### Useful Resources:
# - [United Nations SDGs Overview](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)
# - [Australia's SDG Progress](https://www.sdgdata.gov.au)
# - [SDG Indicators](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/)
#
# ### This App
# - The first purpose of this App is to Explore the data and
# find trends between Sustainable Development Indicators.
# For example, is there any relationships between "Unemployment Rate" and "Literacy Rate"?
# Select these indicators on Exploration page of the App and find out.
# - The second purpose of the App is to Simulate
# how changes in one indicator or a group of indicators would influence other indicators.
# For example, if you change literacy rate and gini coefficient what the change is in homocides if any.
# Go to Simulation page and see.
# This App is developed based on real world data. The modeling is still under development and any help is highly appreciated.
